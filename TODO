- Return an HTTP ReadStream when NPN fails to negotiate spdy.
- Take an HTTPMessage as input as well as NSURLs
 - Add a test for multiple headers with the same key.
- Reuse connections to the same hosts when there is an active request on it.
- Keep connections open for a bit of time after all active requests are
 done
