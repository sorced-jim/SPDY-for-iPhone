SPDY-for-iPhone is a project to create an easy to use library for SPDY.  A
pre-built binary is available in install/lib/libSPDY.a.

To use libSPDY.a:
1) Copy both install/lib/libSPDY.a and install/include/SPDY/SPDY.h into your
project.
2) Add the CFNetwork and SystemConfiguration frameworks to your list of
libraries to link against.
3) Follow the API in SPDY.h.

==========================================================================
Building libSPDY.a
==========================================================================
libSPDY.a has a few external dependencies.  These are included as git
submodules and built using the venerable make.  The external libraries are:
- spdylay
- openssl (Included until Apple releases iOS with an NPN enabled OpenSSL)
- zlib

The external libraries require the following programs to build:
- pkgconfig
- automake
- autoconf
- libtool

I typically install these programs through MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).
Fink or homebrew should also have these packages.

To build build the external libraries and libSPDY.a run the following commands:
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ make
