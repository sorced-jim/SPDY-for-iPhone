This is a project to build an easy to use SPDY library for the iPhone.

The following external libraries are used:
- spdylay
- openssl (Included until Apple releases iOS with an NPN enabled OpenSSL)

The external libraries are pulled in through git submodules.  To build
the demo, you must first run do the following:
git submodule init
git submodule update
make

Then the demo can be loaded in xcode and run from xcode or from the
command line.
